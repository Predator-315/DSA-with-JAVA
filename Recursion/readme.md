# Recursion
- ### When a function calls itself in its own body, then it is a recursive function.
- ### Whenever a function is called/invoked, it creates a stack frame on the call stack & upon its completion of execution, the stack frame gets removed from the call stack.
- ### The call stack works on the principle of LIFO(Last in First Out).
